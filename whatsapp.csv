11/15/19,8:09, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, Pleasure to have you join us
11/15/19,8:32, AcidiQ, Thank you Boss.. I've accessed the Doc file. Hope I'm free to work on any Ministry and extract relevant data?
11/15/19,8:34, +234 907 199 5587," Good morning data fellows, can anyone please share the framework/template you're using to input the extracted data so someone don't do something else, thanks."
11/15/19,8:40, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, Yes. Any MDA that is left *Open* can be worked on.
11/15/19,8:42, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, Do you mean the function that is used to extract the structured data?. The tutorial for that is ongoing and should be available latest tomorrow.. The way the output should look has been covered in Tutorial 1.
11/15/19,8:42, AcidiQ," Ok, great."
11/15/19,9:14, +234 907 199 5587," Ok, thanks"
11/15/19,10:06, Analoh RESAGRATIA," There's a collaboration spreadsheet available, you should work on only Ministries that are *open*. once you decide on a ministry to work on, change the staus field to ""In-progress"" and add your name as the collaborator"

11/19/19,10:49, Analoh RESAGRATIA," Hey guys, please @2347069002818  the collaboration sheets says you've completed 12 MDA's, I'm yet to receive any of the final excel files from you"

11/19/19,18:37, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, Okay great. Niice üí™üèΩ. Thursday please.
11/19/19,18:37, +234 806 351 4863, This Thursday??
11/19/19,18:41, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," The data engineering aspect is almost completed. The remaining MDAs will not require as much time to split the documents. So let's try to get that aspect out of the way latest this Thursday.. Of course anyone can still continue practicing with the data, however, submissions for the remaining MDAs should come in by Thursday latest."
11/19/19,18:45, +234 806 351 4863," Am trying to get you clearly, I have sent my extracted excel files. The after doing the data cleaning on powerBI, what next?"
11/19/19,18:49, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," Then we will combine everything together, and share a link for anyone to connect to. A schema will be generated, which will enable us create a better data model.. Data analysts and visual gurus would then be able to play around with the data effectively"
11/19/19,19:37, +234 817 190 1732, That's good

11/20/19,11:23, AcidiQ, Pls how does one circumvent the PowerBi sign up procedure?. It's requesting for a work or student email
11/20/19,11:29, +234 813 687 5225, Is it BI desktop you downloaded?
11/20/19,11:29, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," You don't need to sign up. Just click to sign in, then close the sign in dialog box that appears."
11/20/19,11:30, AcidiQ, Yes
11/20/19,11:30, AcidiQ," Ok, thank you Boss"
11/20/19,11:30, +234 813 687 5225, Yelp..... It's been answered already
11/20/19,13:17, +234 806 351 4863," Hi @2348062991199  the videos aren't very clear, couldn't see clearly the things you clicked on.  Can you share a better one? Was forcing my eyes to see the points you clicked at"
11/20/19,13:24, AcidiQ," In the first video, why was the 3rd file selected?. Are we to repeat the process for all the sub-MDAs?"
11/20/19,13:39, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," Hi, can I know which aspects you couldn't see clearly? I may be able to work you through it remotely.. If you're on mobile, it might be more difficult to follow through. Try fullscreen, landscape and pause at any point, if that helps."
11/20/19,13:46, +234 806 351 4863," am using my phone, because i cant connect my phone to the laptop as i have small MB to use on laptop and my office internet doesnt accept youtube videos"
11/20/19,13:50, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, In the first video in Part 3 of the series?. That video went through how to create steps 1 to 3
11/20/19,13:54, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," Ah I see. The video quality reaches 720p which is HD, so I'm guessing you've been viewing a lower quality version. The video is actually large and you would require some data either way. Can your office internet download video from another site so you can watch for later?. If yes, I suggest you use https"
11/20/19,13:55, AcidiQ, Looks like I'm missing something.. I didn't actually extract the Ministry of Power file. I just followed the steps in extracting the MDA's that I'm working on.. Will I have to extract the specific files that were used in the tutorial then apply the functions to my extracted MDAs?
11/20/19,13:56, +234 806 222 9997, The video is actually very very fantastic üëå. My opinion though.
11/20/19,13:58, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," Yes. The tutorials will allow you create two functions to extract expenditure items and capital projects breakdown using the data from the Ministry of Power.. When these functions have been created, you can then extract an MDA you're working on and invoke the functions on them to automatically extract their data.. The tutorials on the Ministry of Power will allow you create a template that can be used for others."
11/20/19,14:01, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, Thanks a lot for the feedback. I'm glad you found it useful
11/20/19,14:05, AcidiQ," Ok, great. Thank you for the insight.. Let me get to work."

11/21/19,9:16, AcidiQ, Thanks a bunch bro. This was very helpful.
11/21/19,9:07, +234 806 079 8098, I can still work on any two MDAs that are in progress
11/21/19,9:08, +234 806 079 8098," @all, If u have in progress in any of the mda. Pls let me know the one I can work it"
11/21/19,9:10, +234 806 079 8098," @2348173559817 pls help check through the worksheet and speak to anyone that still have in progress. For like 2, I can still work on.... Thanks!!!"
11/21/19,9:13, Opeyemi Tosin, Could you also provide an update on the list of completed and submitted MDAs?
11/21/19,9:15, +234 706 900 2818," @2348060798098 ,i have made national assembly open. You can work on that"
11/21/19,9:16, +234 806 079 8098, Alright.. Thanks
11/21/19,9:16, AcidiQ, I'm also open to any free MDA
11/21/19,9:20, Opeyemi Tosin, Guys help a brother biko üôåüèø I need an MDA to work on. Hope the deadline will extend to 11
11/21/19,9:24, +234 706 900 2818, You are welcome
11/21/19,9:25, AcidiQ, @2348173559817 Judiciary MDA has just two pages. Does this explain why the expenditure custom function is giving an error feedback.. What's the best way to approach this.
11/21/19,10:35, Analoh RESAGRATIA, I'll have a look at this
11/21/19,10:36, Analoh RESAGRATIA, Did you split this correctly
11/21/19,10:37, AcidiQ," It has just two pages, one MDA and zero capital projects"
11/21/19,10:37, Analoh RESAGRATIA, ‚ú®‚ú® refer to this if you need your extracted files in excel format
11/21/19,10:37, AcidiQ, I'm thinking of doing it manually.
11/21/19,10:38, Analoh RESAGRATIA," Ok, I'll see to this soonest"
11/21/19,10:38, Analoh RESAGRATIA," Hold on, I'll have a look at it now"
11/21/19,10:42, AcidiQ, Okay
11/21/19,10:57, Analoh RESAGRATIA," Ok, so they're two pages for judiciary"
11/21/19,10:57, Analoh RESAGRATIA, You should split them into two then. Summary and Expenditure
11/21/19,10:58, Analoh RESAGRATIA," Run the function on the expenditure and even capital.. although you won't have any data for capital projects, it's fine that way"
11/21/19,10:59, Analoh RESAGRATIA, Just make sure to send an excel file containing the summary and the expenditures
11/21/19,11:05, AcidiQ, That's my complaint. The expenditure function returns error feedback.. It worked well on for my first MDA.. Kindly check the screenshots I DM'd you
11/21/19,11:22, +234 806 222 9997," Code of conduct is opened now. It was giving me reduced number of capital projects than supposed eventually I found out that the reason for it was the overflowing description of the project name. I would have tried further to find way to do it eventually, but an official assignment is on me to finish, thus I wouldn't want to delay it further. It is opened on the list"
11/21/19,11:22, AcidiQ, I just took it. Let me see if I can resolve the issue.
11/21/19,11:23, Opeyemi Tosin, üò≥  that's fast...

11/21/19,18:03, +234 806 222 9997," Ooooh!. I just dealt with a similar thing few hours ago.. Not hard.. There could be a number of ways to go about it.. One way is to split that column with the space condition (you may choose every space, if the digits are into 6 or more)  as the thing to look for. Then after splitting, merge them again with nothing as condition to join them in between. That way, the space would have gone.. However make sure that the column you select first is the one that should start your actual number, or in that sequence if the result splits are more than 2.. After merging, then change data type to whole number or decimal as you might want.. The error is occurring because of how the data was structured from when and/or where imported...which is the space in between them."

In addition, after promoting a row to become the header for the dataset, Power BI automatically adds a query which you can see as ""Changed Type"". You should delete that query from the *Applied steps* pane to prevent automatic formatting into text.. Try if that helps."
11/21/19,20:59, +234 706 900 2818," @2348062229997, this worked perfectly fine.. Much thanks. I'm very grateful for that help"
11/21/19,21:01, +234 706 900 2818," Yeah, I get this too, the challenge is that, the data was formatted like that from source. It's a bank statement.. Thank you @2348062991199 for your assistance as well"
11/21/19,21:05, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, Splendid!
11/21/19,21:18, +234 706 900 2818," That automatic ""changed type"" can be annoying. If not removed, results in data loss."
11/21/19,21:32, +234 806 222 9997, üëç
11/21/19,21:33, +234 806 222 9997," Even removing 'changed type' never did mine too, so I had to implement that. Pquery is as powerful as your imagination can carry you."
11/21/19,21:34, +234 806 222 9997, You are welcome @2347069002818
11/21/19,21:37, +234 706 900 2818," Very very. I was just laughing at myself after implementing the steps you gave.. I was like, Wow... so easy? And it has been there all along."
11/25/19,9:30, +234 706 900 2818," Good morning Admin,. I'd like to know our next line of action on the project"
11/25/19,9:34, +234 817 190 1732, Same here

11/25/19,10:02, Analoh RESAGRATIA," Also, there's plan for a workshop already, we'll have more information about this before the week runs out. The idea for the workshop is to strategize on how we want to approach creating visualisation for the data, learn some design techniques etc."
11/25/19,10:03, Analoh RESAGRATIA," After this, We'll have individuals collaborate on building dashboards and reports of their choosing before a final workshop for the year"
11/25/19,10:09, Analoh RESAGRATIA," In the final workshop, we plan for it to be a discussion about the budget. Hopefully, by this time, senate would have signed the budget.. We'll re-create our process, this time, using the signed budget and have each of the collaborators talk about any MDA's of their choosing and explain insights that they have uncovered. This is likely going to be in partnership with some civic organisations (more on this soonest).. *Watch this space guys!!*"
11/25/19,10:10, Analoh RESAGRATIA, *TLDR; Expect another workshop soonest* üòÅ

Firstly, I want to thank very much those who've contributed to this project and those who've joined us to try their hands on automation in Power BI. We have the aggregated data that will be made available on the website shortly (I'm working to get it online right now).. From this point forward, you will be able to create a nice data model, details of which I'll also include a post tomorrow. For those that understand how to generate the schema in Excel, I invite you to try to generate one from all the MDAs and begin creating some visualisations.. Also, sorry to disappoint some of you but the next workshop will on *Friday, 6th December*. *Rise Networks* has agreed to host us but this will be for Friday and it is themed"

12-03-19,14:50, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," For Tableau, you might have to install a web data connector.. For Power BI, it's straight forward.. For Python, you may have to do a HTTP request to import data from the web."
12-03-19,14:53, AcidiQ," Okay, thank you Boss. I'd love to use Power B√≠ but I just started learning the software. I'm more comfortable with Python."
12-03-19,14:56, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, That's great. You can build with both tools to ensure you learn PBI on the go.
12-03-19,15:00, Opeyemi Tosin, You can run your python scripts inside powerbi

12-03-19,15:42, Opeyemi Tosin, What determined the budget allocation for each school?
12-03-19,15:43, Analoh RESAGRATIA, I'm guessing Thier individual requirements. Personnel costs
12-03-19,15:44, Analoh RESAGRATIA, It would be interesting to find out
12-03-19,15:44, Opeyemi Tosin, Hmmmm ü§î

12-03-19,15:50, Analoh RESAGRATIA, I was thinking this same thing yesterday
12-03-19,15:50, Opeyemi Tosin, So sorry about that Bro.
12-03-19,15:50, Analoh RESAGRATIA, Even some of the FGC's have been attacked by Boko Haram
12-03-19,15:51, Analoh RESAGRATIA," For example, FGC buni-yadi in Yobe.. 59 boys were killed"
12-03-19,15:51, Analoh RESAGRATIA, It woiy be interesting to have this as a visual

12-03-19,15:55, AcidiQ, This info was not in the budget right? I'm guessing you did extra research. That's really commendable. Kudos
12-03-19,15:55, Analoh RESAGRATIA, Have a link I can see this?
12-03-19,15:55, Analoh RESAGRATIA," Yes, thanks bro"
12-03-19,15:56, Richie, I extracted it from various websites like united Nation too bad its in Lagos but let me make some calls
12-03-19,16:00, Analoh RESAGRATIA," I'm seeing the capital allocation of this as 564 million.. Both University of Maiduguri and Abuja have proposed capital allocations more than this at 1.3bn and 1.2bn respectively. Besides these two, it's capital allocation is higher than all other institutions"
12-03-19,16:00, Analoh RESAGRATIA," Ok, I'll appreciate. But don't stress too much about it"
12-03-19,16:01, Analoh RESAGRATIA, @2347069002818
12-03-19,16:01, Opeyemi Tosin, How many schools in total?
12-03-19,16:02, Analoh RESAGRATIA, You mean Universities or secondary schools?
12-03-19,16:02, Opeyemi Tosin, *Universities
12-03-19,16:04, +234 706 900 2818," With the exception of universities of maiduguri, and abuja,. if you check capital allocations for universities of benin, jos, ibadan, ilorin, lagos, and calabar combined, its not up to 564m"
12-03-19,16:04, Analoh RESAGRATIA, <Media omitted>
12-03-19,16:06, +234 706 900 2818," this is the total allocation, i think. can you filter for capital projects, perhaps you find an anomaly"
12-03-19,16:06, Opeyemi Tosin, They are all new schools üòÅ
12-03-19,16:08, Analoh RESAGRATIA, This is true

12-04-19,11:33, +234 809 837 4664, I'm on it. Just a problem with the sub-MDAs
12-04-19,11:36, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," Can you check the column distribution for the MDA column?. Because many column headers were included in the combine operation, you have to remove them"

12-04-19,12:37, +234 809 837 4664," I had to uncheck the enable load for summary by sub-MDAs, and rename the 'errors in summary by sub-MDA' to ""summary by sub-MDA"" since it contained added index and I check 'enable load'. Closed and applied, and it worked fine"
12-04-19,12:37, +234 809 837 4664, Yes. Thank you very much
12-04-19,12:39, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," Your Summary by sub-MDAs should also connect directly to the Expenditure Items. A many-to-many relationship, I think"

12-05-19,18:42, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," A slicer is a way to visualise and apply a filter to a chart. Filters generally allow you to group data, show top x visuals, and categorise data for a visual or for an entire report."
12-05-19,18:43, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, A slicer in Power BI is a visual. You drop categorical data which helps you filter your data.. A filter is not a visual.

12-06-19,1:45, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, It won't fully convey the info that it should. It's tough designing dashboards that satisfy both static and dynamic reports

12-08-19,19:09, Opeyemi Tosin, Inside life
12-08-19,19:23, +234 806 222 9997," Both Tableau and Power BI have their strengths.. I have done projects with the two.. Truly power query is fantastic, but we shouldn't forget that Excel as the grandparent has evolved over the years. Excel is more than 30 years old.. When I see power query generating codes for steps done, I reminisce on VBA and macros because that's the way the latter too generates codes when put to record actions.. Tableau is just 10 years plus, and it's very fantastic too. And again there are many packages to Tableau. When you are talking of data cleaning/preprocessing, Tableau Prep as a variant of the software, will do more for you than Tableau online or Desktop in data preparation, that's however unlike Power BI that everything is bundled into one software. And Tableau has way much more types of charts you can play with than Power BI. It will surprise you to know how many various charts you can make out of either column or bar charts alone. Power BI doesn't have that luxury, and when you need to supplement, you would have to be searching in the store.. Summary, both are good, have strengths and weaknesses."
12-08-19,19:28, Opeyemi Tosin, Well said Bro.... But which one do you prefer?
12-08-19,19:35, +234 806 222 9997," I don Lagoon and Atlantic o, I have settle with Power BI for many reasons.. Even power BI desktop is a tip of the iceberg when seen from the perspective of power BI service. I won't forget to add the AI/machine learning/text analytics already tools in power bi and all that..

12-08-19,19:38, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, Plus Power Automate and Power Apps give a whole new dimension to BI and automation.
12-08-19,19:41, Opeyemi Tosin," Microsoft ain't smiling at all, I won't even be surprised if I find out that they have made several mores to purchase Tableau."

I don't know who is thinking for them and telling them what to add or improve.. We need to learn so.much from these people in this part of the world. People creating mad invention out of nothing, with worth more than countries GDP.. I saw a couple of days ago that worth of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and 2 other companies' is.much more than nearly all the African countries GDP.. Those are companies that are built on purely power of imagination and creativity.. Truly the best and greatest wealth come from the invisible realm, the mind to be specific."

12-09-19,22:00, +234 806 489 8353, can u shed more light on this pls?
12-09-19,22:06, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," Awesome! Thanks for asking.. There are some items which are not included in the national budget breakdown. If you look at the appropriation bill on the budget office website, however, you will see a brief total breakdown summing up to 10 trillion+. This is one of the reasons why I was hoping a finance professional was here who could help us out."
12-09-19,22:07, Opeyemi Tosin, Maybe we should outsource for financial gurus.
12-09-19,22:09, +234 806 489 8353," Okay, thanks a lot @2348062991199, you are amazing ."
12-09-19,22:11, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, Sure thing. You too bro üòÅ
12-09-19,22:33, +234 806 489 8353, üôáüôáüôá
12-10-19,11:48, +234 806 351 4863, Good morning everyone
12-10-19,11:49, +234 806 351 4863, Please I need you guys assistance. Does anyone know how I can get sample questions of IKM test for data analytics role?. Thanks
12-10-19,15:28, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," Never heard of IKM test, sorry"
12-10-19,21:28, +234 806 489 8353, <Media omitted>
12-10-19,21:31, AcidiQ, Total budget allocation is not 9 trillion but about 10.59 trillion. We'll need to resolve this.. Nice visualization. Try adjusting your color combinations.
12-10-19,21:34, +234 806 489 8353," Yea, I thought as much, the background colour is dull.. I just realised that after publishing."
12-10-19,21:35, Opeyemi Tosin, This writeup will help you.. https
12-10-19,21:36, Opeyemi Tosin, Also you can't use donut chart for all MDAs... It's difficult to understand the point you are driving out.
12-10-19,21:37, +234 806 489 8353, Thanks for sharing Tosin.
12-10-19,21:38, Opeyemi Tosin, @2348064898353 üëÜüèø
12-10-19,21:39, +234 806 489 8353, I think it works well like a pie chart also.
12-10-19,21:39, +234 806 489 8353, üëèüëèüëè
12-10-19,21:40, Opeyemi Tosin, Yes but for best practice ehn... U use donut & pie chart for max. of 3-4 variables.
12-10-19,21:46, +234 806 489 8353," You are right, the next chart shows the top 10 MDAs by allocation, follow by top 10 capital project .. The idea of the design was to be strategic, and analytical just like you have pointed out .. The donut charts shows all the mdas, while the bar charts shows the top 10 mdas."
12-11-19,10:40, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," Morning guys,. I will share a template today on how the visuals will be collated and displayed on our website, so we can officially close this project.. We'll be uploading the PBIX files online, attributed to the creators who'll be sharing a few takeaways from their visuals"
12-11-19,11:48, Opeyemi Tosin, Awesome ü§ó
12-11-19,12:20, +234 806 222 9997, <Media omitted>
12-11-19,12:28, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, All thanks to you all o üôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇ
12-11-19,20:53, +234 809 837 4664," Still waiting on this.. Again, all the visuals will be on one report abi? (One will just have different pages). Yeah?"
12-11-19,20:55, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," One sec, been really busy"
12-11-19,21:11, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, <Media omitted>
12-11-19,21:18, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," Very straightforward actually.. We need about 10 stellar visuals with powerful insights to go along.. To allow more contributors, we'll be limiting this to *1 visual per report author.*. So guys, let's extract some useful insights from this budget that will be showcased to the world. And trust me, people are watching!!! üòÅ. I would ask that when you have your visuals ready, you forward the PBIX file directly to me - servus@resagratia.com.. We can discuss your visual on this forum before you send it in. I'll create another sheet on the contributors worksheet now. This will serve as the collaboration sheet for the visuals.. Let me know what y'all think üôèüèº"
12-11-19,21:19, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," Oh, I want this to go out Monday or Tuesday next week."
12-11-19,21:26, AcidiQ, This is great.
12-11-19,21:26, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, https
12-11-19,21:27, AcidiQ, I think it's a great idea. Is it one visual or one report?
12-11-19,21:27, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, Okay I mentioned *1 visual per report author* earlier. I'm thinking we can have *up to 2 reports* within the same PBIX file.
12-11-19,21:28, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," So, 1 PBI file, up to 2 reports (2 pages)"
12-11-19,21:32, AcidiQ," Okay, great. Thank you Boss."
12-11-19,21:35, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, Cheers bro
12-11-19,21:36, Opeyemi Tosin," Good one @2348062991199 , thanks for the update. The template is on point to the best of my knowledge and I think the timing too is cool. Atleast we have all the weekend to sit down with the data and get more revelations from it. I will try repackage my initial visual for ministry of power and also add Federal Ministry of Health to it. Thanks again and again my Oga."
12-11-19,21:55, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, Niice. Well done. Let me know when you're working on the Ministry of Health 
12-11-19,21:56, +234 813 697 8068," I dont fully understand this, do you mean each person should select just one ministry and create a visual with it?"
12-11-19,21:58, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," Hmm not exactly one ministry, although that would make things simpler.. For the PBI file that you will submit, it shouldn't have more than 2 pages i.e. 2 reports"
12-11-19,21:59, Opeyemi Tosin, I will start looking into it on Friday. I noticed that Obinna too is also interested in the Federal Ministry of Health. My plan is to ask reasonable questions about the budget and visualise it with an eye catching visuals. I hope powerbi won't gimme tough time üòÉ
12-11-19,21:59, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, I hope so too o. So we have more than 1 author working on the Ministry of Health hmm
12-11-19,22:02, Opeyemi Tosin, I remember someone did some visualisation on how much the goverment intend to spend on newspapper and event. I don't think this have to do with any MDA na... so it won't be a bad idea to have something like this.
12-11-19,22:06, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, It's a great idea. You can mix and match!
12-11-19,22:07, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," But please, have a story to make people curious, with a clear direction"
12-11-19,22:08, +234 813 697 8068, Oh okay
12-11-19,22:08, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," For the engineers in the house, don't worry, another project underway!!"
12-11-19,22:19, +234 813 697 8068, Is it okay for two authors to work on the same ministry?
12-11-19,22:20, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," First instinct is no. However, if the authors have different information to portray then sure thing!"
12-11-19,22:21, +234 813 697 8068, Okay
12-11-19,23:46, +234 809 837 4664," Straight forwardüíØüíØ. I already have a report for about 6 to 7 visuals. But to do this now, will I have to reconnect to the overall data again online and go back to the stages of cleaning to come about the star schema?. Or will I have to delete all I have done before and just limit to only two pages?"
12-11-19,23:47, +234 809 837 4664, üí™üí™
12-11-19,23:51, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, You can duplicate your PBI file.. Remove other reports that you don't want to include in your submission.. You can refresh if you want but you don't need to reconnect and redo any transformations.
12-12-19,0:33, +234 809 837 4664, I grab this nowüíØ. Thank you

The best will be to leave this aspect on visuals generation open while we continuously update the platform where they'll be posted.. I've begun working with some people regarding the visuals they submitted. The goal is to let your visual have a clear focus, so you can tell a story around it. Early next week I will begin posting the insights and visuals.. Also, the breakdown of the new budget is out, but the link isn't available. Anyone had any luck with this?. I've been thinking about a before and after comparison. We know the expenditure has increased."

12/27/19,21:06, Opeyemi Tosin," Correction.... Click on the filters available under the menu in your visual page, select filter type = Top N. Show items = Top/Bottom and enter 10 in the text field. Specify the By value (first, last, count(distinct) & count).. I think this should help."

12/31/19,14:20, +234 806 079 8098," Well in as much as we want to deliver value.. I think good negotiations on some terms and conditions might be considered. Options of remote work could be considered.. Except one has work experience(s) of whether a Business Intelligence or data analyst or data scientists. I strongly feel accepting an offer between 150k -200k for such position is not too bad to have real time experience of what it takes to work in such position..... Because working on a real project at work is different from whatever knowledge we might have acquired during training or learning to become better.. Most employer might not want to pay much for just being a data analyst except u have some other skills set to solve their peculiar problem because everyone claims to be a data analyst even an excel user will tell u, they can do better than u do..."

12/31/19,14:31, +234 806 079 8098, I think @2348062991199 is doing so much in that aspect and you could private chat him for how you can collaborate with him. There are some other guys out there too that do data analytics consulting. Except you want to take the bull by the horn and cave a niche for yourself in that area....
12/31/19,14:32, +234 909 964 9854, They will pay auditor that‚Äôs just to check whether debit and credit enter wella whereby bi guys can tell if the business will die tomorrow and what it needs to wake up
12/31/19,14:33, +234 909 964 9854," Thanks , I will buzz him"
12/31/19,14:33, +234 809 440 5059, That why I said we need to put an end to that nonsense...

12/31/19,14:36, +234 909 964 9854," Can we get like a mail or a place whereby we can collate all the skills of everyone here , share it and create that solid team"
12/31/19,14:36, +234 703 235 3516, Imagine.
12/31/19,14:37, +234 809 440 5059," The CEO of BlueChip is a Data Scientist trained abroad, worked for MTN for less than a year, resigned because he felt he was been underpaid. Firstbank tried to employ him he asked if they can pay 25million per month.. They sat tight"
12/31/19,14:37, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, Auditors are bosses o. The amount of financial reporting standards and procedures in their heads no be here o. It's just unfortunate the processes are mostly manual
12/31/19,14:37, AcidiQ," Lol, as much as we all want to get nice rides and stuff I believe money should not be the driving force behind our work.. We should aim to solve problems peculiar to the business or firm you find yourself. Trust me the money will naturally follow."
12/31/19,14:39, +234 909 964 9854," They are just to ensure that the books are in conformity with the accounting standards that‚Äôs all , they are not far from data engineers that ensure that data conform with analysis standards"

12/31/19,14:39, +234 806 079 8098," @2348062991199  I think @2349099649854 raised a good point here for consideration. Is it something, you would love to do?"
12/31/19,14:39, AcidiQ," Some firms might abuse your work and pay you peanuts but at the end of the day, you'll grow to a point where better offers would chase you."
12/31/19,14:40, Richie, Standing your ground sometimes doesn't means to stand on both feet...use a warrior strategy.... A case example of Adof hilter...... You think because you know ABC you should be paid xyz.. Yes correct but that's the same thing people thought starting a business will give them 3m in few months..... Calm down you will earn big later
12/31/19,14:41, +234 703 235 3516," Bro, if money were to be the force, maybe I will be asking for  at least 500k. I am in for anything value. Infact it's a crime to get paid, for a value you can't offer. But a level is comfort is required for you to deliver. Take it or leave it, there are bills to be paid."

I told him everything the auditors sit to do in a day, I will use one script to run audit and get my findings withing 5mins..

12/31/19,14:45, +234 809 440 5059, That shit
12/31/19,14:45, AcidiQ," Yea true talk. That's where compromise comes in.. Since you've compromised and reduced your salary demands to as low as can go and the firm feels they can't pay, you have nothing to worry about.. Better offers will always come."
12/31/19,14:46, +234 809 440 5059," We need to reject all this treatment, else we wont be able to practice what we learnt with sleepless nights"

12/31/19,14:52, AcidiQ, Yea facts. Majority of Nigeria's workforce need to up-skill/re-skill themselves.
12/31/19,14:52, +234 809 440 5059, Have a job for me?
12/31/19,14:52, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," üòÖ Script that you can spend a few days writing and debugging abi?. Be careful o, cuz an auditor with BI knowledge is a sure guy"
12/31/19,14:52, Richie, So is it part of data analysis??
12/31/19,14:52, +234 809 440 5059, No

12/31/19,14:53, +234 909 964 9854, Accountant*
12/31/19,14:53, +234 909 964 9854, The best match are management accountants and they are not far from business analysts
12/31/19,14:53, +234 909 964 9854," They are as good as data engineers, simple"
12/31/19,14:54, Richie, So you see why data analysis or data science is not everything..... Your combination of data science and your field od study makes data science interesting..... So leave auditor or accountant alone üòÑ
12/31/19,14:55, +234 706 811 1035, I disagree with you. Data analyst work is different from that of Accountants and Auditors. What I just think is that Accountants and Auditors also need to equip themselves with data analysis skills for them to be  able to add more value to business in the nearest future.
12/31/19,14:55, +234 809 440 5059, They can't be kicked out.. Software will only be deployed to make their work faster.. Their job is different
12/31/19,14:55, +234 809 440 5059, They are the resident Police of any organisation

12/31/19,14:56, +234 909 964 9854, Or software plus AI will do the work
12/31/19,14:56, +234 909 964 9854," It‚Äôs no brainer , just bunch of rules"
12/31/19,14:56, +234 809 440 5059," An analyst will not see, how an amount was spent and if actually it was spent on what its meant for. But auditors will see it.. I just hate their manual way of life"
12/31/19,14:57, +234 706 811 1035, Data analysis software only does not make one a good business advisor.
12/31/19,14:58, +234 909 964 9854, Yeah too manual
12/31/19,14:58, +234 809 440 5059," The human part, can not be over emphasized.. AI may reduce auditors from 10 to 2 but will never erase that function."
12/31/19,14:59, +234 909 964 9854, Even fraud that is the major reason for auditors can be dealt with by data analysts like nothing
12/31/19,15:01, +234 909 964 9854, Yeah the two are the people that coded the AI üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

01-03-20,19:26, Richie, Jx saw a post related to this
01-03-20,19:50, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA, My brother why you dey japa?
01-03-20,20:22, +234 703 275 3450, Boss.. Please I'm interested
01-04-20,1:46, +234 809 440 5059, Alot of things are discouraging here.
01-04-20,1:49, +234 809 440 5059," @2348062991199 Do you know that in Nigeria now, it a crime to have your looks (beard)?. Then it'll confirm to SARS that one is one of the people they are looking for when they now see a LAPTOP with you.. Don't try to show them an ID, they won't listen"
01-04-20,1:53, +234 809 440 5059," A Nigeria that works with SWAT abroad, come home for holiday and was harassed by this SARS people. The guy wished he had his gun with him, the 8 of them them would have been buried by now. The guy said it does not take him more than 24hrs to terminate the IG of police and he does not need to be there; a drone will do the job. Those were his last sentence before he left Nigeria."
01-04-20,2:06, +234 809 440 5059," Again, you see the way thing are going, public officials mal-handling and squandering our funds, Nigeria isn't producing anything; that are sign that we are never gonna develop.. Unemployment everywhere, I went through a job package abroad meant for someone whose only required skill is Advance Excel and VBA, thats all. I wanted to cry!. This is a skill Nigeria never knew exist of never saw reason to align with.. An acclaimed HR Group Head in Nigeria with numerous certifications will list the skilled of a Data Scientist for just a Project Analyst.. List the skills of a System Engineer for an Information Technologist. Mistaken the skills of a Full Programmer an ordinary Front End Web DevOps. And they'll be bragging about it saying they have been practicing HR for 25yrs, 30yrsü§£ü§£. I just tire!"
01-04-20,6:23, +234 706 900 2818," I wonder a lot when I see the job requirements for a lot of tech jobs.. Do these people really know what they are doing?. The HRs I think are trying to suit their employers. Get someone who can do 10 things for the price of 1. And this makes me cringe a lot.. On the flip side, this has allowed us to be versatile, but it also steals our ability to create and innovate effectively.. The hope for a better Nigeria is always looking like a mirage.. If we've got the opportunity to better our lives somewhere else, it's no crime. After all, all our so called leaders can run anywhere anytime."
01-04-20,6:51, AcidiQ," The future looks bleak for Nigeria. I'm an optimist and as much as I'll love to say ""E go better"", I'll just be playing to the gallery and wallowing in self-deceit.. The employment space in Nigeria has a lot of fundamental issues. From meagre pay to companies advertising for jobs that they don't even understand the job description. Most companies don't even know what they want, they list requirements for a job and expect 1 person to have the skills of an entire Data science team.. The short-term goal is to get a job (bills need to be paid) but long-term we should think about creating our own businesses and changing the tech space in Nigeria.. Fact is"
01-04-20,7:11, +234 809 440 5059," No, not in all cases. You may say 1 out of 20 cases is trying to get the best hand for the client; But the rest is IGNORANCE."
01-04-20,7:13, +234 809 440 5059," They don't know what it entails, they just go through Google search, see what other mediocre HR people like them have written, then adopt it.. And the rubbish keeps trending."
01-04-20,7:18, +234 809 440 5059, NO CERTIFICATE can make you a SCIENTIST or an ANALYST.... You have to earn it by EXPERIENCE.. The output of your work must have been consumed by TOP MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS and SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. They are only one that can grade you on how your work has impacted business(es).
01-04-20,7:24, +234 809 440 5059," If i'm asked.... Inside the Job of a Data Analyst there some other sub-jobs like. ~Dash Board Designer. ~Data Modeler. ~Data Entry Officer. ~VBA expert. etc.... A Data Analyst will become better by the day on the job. Some that has not laid hands on official projects to test his ability in Analytic and gain experience will rush to start doing ML and AI.. At the become jack of all trade, never better at a single one."
01-04-20,7:27, +234 816 249 9900, You people should publish an article
01-04-20,7:27, +234 816 249 9900, It probably will go viral

I was learning python, machine learning, excel, tableau, power bi, and unfortunately for me, my learning was so unstructured, and I was completely worse off, than I started..

01-06-20,18:48, +234 706 900 2818," Hello all,. Please how do you go about the issue of wide data gap in visualization?. For instance, I want to show number of suicides per country, while majority of the values for most countries are in hundreds, countries like China, India are having data in thousands, and tens of thousands.. How do you go about scaling this on your axis?"
01-06-20,18:53, Opeyemi Tosin, What type of visualisation are you using!
01-06-20,18:54, +234 809 440 5059, Which visual are u using?
01-06-20,18:54, Opeyemi Tosin, This message was deleted
01-06-20,18:54, Opeyemi Tosin, I will advise you use a Scatter plot and make the x-axis logarithmic scale.
01-06-20,18:55, +234 706 900 2818," A line chart, cos it's over a period"
01-06-20,18:56, Opeyemi Tosin, You will also need the country's population for the size of the bubble.
01-06-20,18:59, +234 806 222 9997," Line chart wouldn't be the best as far power BI is concerned, Tableau could have done synced dual visualisation to make it look appreciable but not Power BI in that regard. Better to use scatter plot like @2348110895622 rightly said."
01-06-20,19:04, +234 809 440 5059, He may need country population
01-06-20,19:05, Opeyemi Tosin, Yeah.... Tableau will handle it seemlessly. You can handle add a year filter and play the visualisation to see the trend per year. I dunno if PowerBI latest update was enhanced to handle this type of visualisation (bubble size increase per country's population).
01-06-20,19:08, +234 806 222 9997," Yeah, most likely. Or it depends. It depends on what he wants to bring out.. Data in the hands of an analyst is up to him what he wants to paint.. I don't know the source of his data, but I have got a data like this time past to do stuffs with, I abandoned it later, I think based on many missing data or something.. But like I said, where I got mine could be different from his."
01-06-20,19:09, +234 706 900 2818," Yeah, population as well... it tells the story more"
01-06-20,19:09, +234 706 900 2818, This was from gapminder.com. It was surprising there was no missing data
01-06-20,19:10, +234 706 900 2818, Much noted...Thanks
01-06-20,19:11, +234 806 222 9997," Ohh! That's good.. Missing data comes with its own horror, especially where you can't suggest it by some reasonable statistical methods"
01-06-20,19:11, +234 806 222 9997, You are welcome
01-06-20,21:46, Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA," I would advise a log scale too. Scatter plot or line chart, it's up to you and the dimensions of data you have."
01-06-20,22:59, +234 706 900 2818, Thanks boss
